A place for ideas, &amp; resources

Hi! My name is Jackie.  I have a dog named Storm who loves bird watching.
I'm new to Github and learning how it flows.  I'm new this past year to coding. I've worked in Property Management for the past 17 years and just need a change, and desire something more.  I started with HTML, CSS, and now learning Java, and a slight detour and picking up learning Microsoft Azure for cloud learning. Wish me luck!
